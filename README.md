Workcraft is a cross-platform toolset to capture, simulate, synthesize
and verify graph models. It supports a wide range of popular graph
formalisms and provides a plugin-based framework to model and analyze
new model types. For more information about Workcraft look at
https://workcraft.org/.

### Getting source

Get Workcraft source code and submodules for its platform-specific backend tools
([workcraft-dist-template](https://github.com/workcraft/workcraft-dist-template) repo)
and documentation ([workcraft-doc](https://github.com/workcraft/workcraft-doc) repo):

    git clone https://github.com/workcraft/workcraft.git
    cd workcraft
    git submodule update --init --remote

### Building

Workcraft requires Java JDK 8 or newer for a successful build and is
assembled via [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).
It is tested with both [Open JDK](http://openjdk.java.net/) and
[Oracle JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

These instructions use `gradlew`, a wrapper that downloads and runs
a relatively new version of `gradle`. Alternatively a pre-installed
version can be used.

Use the `assemble` task to build the core and all the plugins:

    ./gradlew assemble

### Running

You can run Workcraft directly after building it:

    ./gradlew run

Note that Workcraft relies on backend tools for some of its functionality
and expects them in `tools` directory by default. Therefore create a
symbolic link pointing to the location of the backend tools for your
platform. E.g. for Linux:

    ln -s dist/template/linux/tools
